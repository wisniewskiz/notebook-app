# My Notebook - A Fullstack Webapp to Organize your Notes and Thoughts

This portfolio project came about as a way to practice fullstack web development while making something that I could see my peers and myself using on a daily basis. The aim is to have a large collection of notes that can be organized by chosen topics, or seen all together. Think of it like a three ring binder with the ability to lay everything out and see the bigger picture of your colleciton of ideas, notes, and todo's at large.
